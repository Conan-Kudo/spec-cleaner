spec-cleaner
============

Architecture
----------------

- class SpecFile
  - holds spec file abstraction

- class SimpleRewriter
  - rewrites a part of one line (something like encapsulated sed)
  - attributes:
    * pattern
    * replacement
    * on which section to apply (package, description, prep, build, install, clean, scriptlets*, files, changelog)
    * priority - determines the order of application (0 - first, 99 - last)
